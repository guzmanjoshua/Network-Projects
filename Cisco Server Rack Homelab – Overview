# Cisco Server Rack Homelab â€“ Project Series  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository documents my **physical Cisco server rack homelab**, designed to simulate enterprise-style networking and monitoring. The goal of this project series is to build, configure, and manage a multi-device lab environment that demonstrates key **networking, cybersecurity, and monitoring skills** aligned with real-world IT operations.  

The homelab is powered by Cisco routers and switches, alongside Raspberry Pis running Splunk, Prometheus, and Grafana for **centralized logging and performance monitoring**. This series is structured step-by-step, showing how the environment was built and expanded over time.

## ðŸ”§ Hardware & Tools  
- Cisco 2951, 2911, 2901 Routers  
- Cisco Catalyst 3560 (L3) & 2960 (L2) Switches  
- Raspberry Pi 4 & 5 (Monitoring, DHCP, Syslog, SIEM)  
- Custom Server Rack Setup  
- Windows/Linux clients for testing and monitoring

## ðŸ“‚ Project Series  

### General  
- **[Cisco Server Rack Homelab - Overview](./overview)**  
- **[Cisco Server Rack Homelab - Network Topology Diagram](./topology-diagram)**  

### Step-by-Step Builds  
1. **[Part 1 - Base Configuration](./part1-base-config)**  
   - Initial router/switch setup, console access, config-register fixes, and password recovery.  

2. **[Part 2 - WAN to LAN with VLANs & NAT](./part2-vlans-nat)**  
   - VLAN creation, inter-VLAN routing, NAT setup, and WAN-to-LAN simulation.  

3. **[Part 3 - DHCP Migration to Raspberry Pi](./part3-dhcp-pi)**  
   - Migrating DHCP services from Cisco IOS to Raspberry Pi, configuring helper-addresses.  

4. **[Part 4 - Centralized Logging with Splunk](./part4-splunk-logging)**  
   - Forwarding syslogs from Cisco routers/switches to Splunk Enterprise on Pi 5.  
   - Indexing and enrichment with VLAN/device lookup tables.  

5. **[Part 5 - Metrics Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana](./part5-prometheus-grafana)**  
   - Collecting metrics with Node Exporter & Cisco SNMP Exporter.  
   - Visualizing system and network health in Grafana dashboards.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Skills Demonstrated  
- Cisco IOS configuration (routers, switches, VLANs, NAT, DHCP, OSPF/EIGRP)  
- Enterprise-style network design and troubleshooting  
- SIEM log management and enrichment (Splunk)  
- Metrics-based observability (Prometheus + Grafana)  
- Hybrid monitoring with logs + metrics for full visibility  
- Automation with PowerShell for Active Directory labs  
- Applying security/compliance frameworks (NIST 800-53, PCI-DSS)  

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps  
Future updates will expand into:  
- High availability testing with HSRP/VRRP  
- Advanced ACLs and firewall rule tuning  
- SNMP + Syslog integration in a single dashboard  
- Automation scripts for backup/restore and config management
